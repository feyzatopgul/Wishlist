# Wishlist
This is my final project at Advanced iOS Development course in UCSC Silicon Valley Extension program. 

This app keeps all your whishes in a simple list. 

3 basic steps for adding a wish
  * Add item's photo (take photo or use from library)
  * Add additional info (price, store, notes)
  * Save, edit and delete item
 
Add an item url directly from browser via Share Extension
